Copy and paste your configuration.yaml into here and click "Parse!"<br /><br />Once you have your configuration.yaml parsed, it will give you a list of files that were requested by your original config file. These are <b>optional</b>. You can add them later by clicking "back to parse" (probably just for integrations) or finding your integration in the parsed objects and clicking "create new"<br /><br />After parsing, you can start editing/disabling/deleting integrations and entities.<br />
