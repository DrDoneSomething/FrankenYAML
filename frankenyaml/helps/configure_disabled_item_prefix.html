When you disable an item in FrankenYAML and then export it, it will place a special comment line in front of items  that are disabled. This line is ignored by Homeassistant but NOT ignored by FrankenYAML. It does not matter what it is, just keep it consistent so the exported file(s) can later be imported.<br /><br /><b>Ex: Enabled Item</b><br /><pre>customize:<br />  switch.tv_room_top_light:<br />    icon: mdi:lightbulb-on-outline</pre><br /><br /><br /><b>Ex: Disabled Item</b><br /><pre>#<DISABLED>||customize:<br />#<DISABLED>||  switch.tv_room_top_light:<br />#<DISABLED>||    icon: mdi:lightbulb-on-outline</pre><br />[title]Disabled Items[/title]
