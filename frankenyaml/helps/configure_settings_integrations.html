This is a list of <b>Settings</b> integrations.<br /><br />They are basically a mix between dictionaries{configure_dict_integrations} and lists{configure_list_integrations}.<br /><br />They are barely changed at all when parsed, except !include* paths are corrected to reflect their relative locations to the integration yaml file, and Nested integrations are added (eg. customize) to divide settings into different objects (and, if you like, can be exported into separate files, like having a file for each customization).<br /><br />If there is a list or dictionary within a setting you wish to have in a separate file, eg dictionary "customize:", add it to the appropriate Nested Dictionary{configure_nested_dict} or Nested List{configure_nested_list} configuration below.<br />[title]What is a Settings Integration?[/title]
