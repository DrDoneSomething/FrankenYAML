<b>List Name Schemes</b> are instructions on how to name a list item{configure_list_integrations}. This is more for naming the files than anything else, because HA is going to do whatever it wants. Each list item needs a unique identifier. This will basically just be used<br />as the file name.<br /><br />Any line in a list that contains a ":" and something after that colon is fair game. The Parse system will call that a "field" and allow you to either identify a type of list item by that field or name it using a field or combination of fields (using [and]).<br /><br />For list items that contain a "platform" equal to "mqtt" the field "name" will be used if you leave the default <i>platform:mqtt -> name</i>.<br /><br />You can also use the integration name. So if you leave the default <i>integration_name:automation -> alias</i>, the 'alias' field will be used<br />as the file name.<br /><br />Lastly, the "field value to set as name" can be concatenated, so if you wanted to add state_topic to platform mqtt file names you could do <i>platform:mqtt -> name[and]state_topic</i>.{configure_list_name_concat} Not sure why you'd want do do this, but you can. <br /><br />I tried doing switch/switches to capture the switch list within my broadlink "switch." Unfortunately entities can't !include entities right now :(<br />[title]List Name Scheme[/title]
