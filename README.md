What Do It Do:

FrankenYAML

  - FrankenYAML will take all your .yaml files for HomeAssistant and turn each entry into an Object.
  - Not exciting enough for you? Well you can then add, edit, delete, disable (comment out), and export it, then re-import it!
  - Not feeling it? You can create an encrypted saved copy (make a login/password) and access it later.
      - otherwise transfers the stuff from panel to panel via exported _POST_ values (your config is stored nowhere but your browser RAM, for better security)
  - Still not good enough? Well you can export either to one big file (makes the pi boot happier) or to a bunch of tiny files like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lndeybw21PY">Frenck did in his setup.</a>
  - Has some built-in help bubbles if you're totally lost
 
 Tasmota List
  - Scans your network for tasmota devices via web send!
  - sends commands
  - does it in a quick and efficient way
  - easily customizable for people who love to do lots of changes to tasmota devices
  - runs on just a php webserver ( no need for MQTT! )

Installation
- Install a web server of your choice
- Install php on that server
