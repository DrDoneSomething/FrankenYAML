If you get a "Cannot find type for integration" parse error, it means I don't have your integration listed and you need to add it. This information is used to help the parser identify list (each item starts with " -"), dictionary (each item starts with no indent), or settings (mostly un-parsed mix of the two) integrations to better slice up their contents.<br /><br />If you add it to the wrong category, home assistant or this program will <b>throw an error.</b><br />[title]Integrations[/title]
