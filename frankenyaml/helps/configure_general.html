Welcome to FrankenYAML 1.0!<br /><br /><h2>{configure_general_video:Introduction Video (YouTube)}</h2><br /><h2>Description:</h2><br />This program will take your yaml files and parse them, starting of course with configuration.yaml. You can gather all your yaml files referenced by confugration.yaml (it will prompt for missing) and dump them into a single 'array'. From there you can manipulate anything you want and export it either into a single file or slice it up* for better file management.<br /><br />*<b>Slicing:</b> This can slice up your configuration into little tiny pieces, just like Frenck did in his video <a href="https://youtu.be/lndeybw21PY">here</a>. It will add/remove/update all the !INCLUDE lines for you! You can then more easily view, edit, and delete your entities and integrations!<br /><br />Inspired by Frenck. Thanks for the idea buddy!<br /><br /><h2>Instructions:</h2><br /><ol><li>Set your parse settings (or don't!)<br /><ul><li>This is optional, you can always do this later.</li></ul></li><br /><li>If it's really important for your unique snowflake configuration, it will prompt you and you can change your settings</li></ul></li><br /><li>Parse your configuration.yaml</li><br /><li>Update parse settings again if needed</li><br /><li>Add "missing files" if desired</li><br /><li>Verify it all looks good, you can even edit, delete, or disable the elements!</li><br /><li>(optional) Go "back to parse" at any time to edit the raw file, add more integrations, or add more files.</li><br /><li>Export your completed file<br /><ul><li>Export into a new, single configuration.yaml file (will include disabled items commented out for later!</li><br /><li>Export into a zip file with everything sorted into directories</li><br /><li>Not ready to export? Create a login and password and it will generate an encrypted backup on the server running FrankenYAML (not available in online version)</li></ul></li></ol><br />[title]Welcome![/title]
