What Do It Do
FrankenYAML
  - FrankenYAML will take all your .yaml files for HomeAssistant and turn each entry into an Object.
  - Not exciting enough for you? Well you can then add, edit, delete, disable (comment out), and export it, then re-import it!
  - Still not good enough? Well you can export either to one big file (makes the pi boot happier) or to a bunch of tiny files like Frenck did in his setup.
 
 Tasmota List
  - Scans your network for tasmota devices via web send!
  - sends commands
  - does it in a quick and efficient way
  - easily customizable for people who love to do lots of changes to tasmota devices
  - runs on just a php webserver ( no need for MQTT! )

Installation
- Install a web server of your choice
- Install php on that server
- put frankenyaml directory in the web directory
- type the url into your web browser
- Note: this saves data to text files so it must have permissions!

Instructions
- Forthcoming! .. ?
